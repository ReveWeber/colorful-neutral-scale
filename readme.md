# "Colorful Neutral" Color Scale Generator

This tiny utility takes a hex color input and simultaneously lightens and desaturates it, in order to create a color scale that could be used as a site's neutral colors without being gray-based.

Inspired by [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette/) as described on [my related blog post](https://www.rweber.net/projects/non-gray-grayscales/), where you can also try it out.
